## How to play LCDRacer

LCDRacer is a classic racing arcade game played on an LCD controlled by Arduino.
`C:>` is your car with three lives. It rides on the racing road and earns speed and points. 
Collect coins (`*`) and powerups (`?`), steer using your joystick, and shoot bullets (`-`) using the red button to destroy obstacles (`#`), targets (`@`), and bombs (`o`) to earn points. Avoid the obstacles and get as many points as you can!
